# Music-Genres-in-Germany

a geographical visualization
------------------------------------------------
**Research project in the field of Digital Humanities by Jan Luhmann and Justus Weise.**


This Repository accrued as part of a research project containing the visualization and evalutation of artists by different music genres in Germany. The Dataset is based on the [Musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) database and for exactly and more precisely tags of a higher number of artists we linked [LastFm](https://www.last.fm/) to our data.

We did used python and  [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) to develop the script and for the geographical visualization we used  [QGIS] (https://qgis.org/en/site/index.html).
